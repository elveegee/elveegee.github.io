          <h2>Strategy, Research, Experience Design for a proposed enhancement to the Panorama web app for increased user engagement</h2>
          <p>I conducted product strategy, user research, user experience design and interface design for a proposed new feature in FrontStream’s Panorama fundraising platform, with the intended outcome to increase frequency and depth of user engagement.

            <p class="body-text">The Success team observed that users were active around the time of first publishing their event page, and at the end of the event season, but there was little engagement in 3-6 months in between.  This caused an upstream risk of stagnating revenue growth, low stickiness, and increased risk of churn.

            How could we improve the product to increase mid-event engagement?

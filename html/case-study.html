          <h1>BROG</h1>
          <p>Bróg (“brogue”), a mobile app for language-learning, interconnects a network of global users, focusing on a narrow goal of improving their foreign language accents.  Users submit daily pronunciation videos for review, and in turn review others, while earning badges for their progress.

          <p class="title">The Challenge</p>
          <p>There are many apps that focus on language learning.  Some provide lessons in grammar and vocabulary, some connect users for open-ended communication, and others focus on pronunciation with voice recognition software.  They each have their shortcomings, from a lack of pronunciation focus, to a lack of human touch.  What if you really wanted to focus on pronunciation and wanted feedback from real native speakers?  No apps on the market are tuned to accommodating this need.</p>

          <p class="title">The Solution</p>
          <p>Bróg presents a unique offering, combining three specific features in a unique recipe for success: (1) a narrow focus on pronunciation, (2) network of users for direct human interaction, and (3) a usage/learning model for quick, daily use.

            <p>The transition from User Research to IA began with users stories: concise micro-goals that each user persona would need to accomplish on the platform.  These User Stories sow the seeds that will later become complete features.

            I really needed users to see how easy it was to complete key actions so they would use the app daily.  I was concerned with users creating an account but never posting their first video.
            <br  /> <br />
            Based on the concept of <span>Instant Gratification</span> from Jennifer Tidwell’s book, <em>Designing Interfaces</em>,  I decided that within the flow of account creation I would embed the process of recording and posting your first pronunciation video.

          <p>Putting on my UX Design hat, I then developed User Flows as a first step toward converting a user story into the framework for a mobile application.
          <br  /><br  />
          Below is an example of the account creation user flow, which includes the process of recording/publishing the user’s first video submission.  See, it’s not so hard!

          Quickly into testing I realized that my "front-loaded" account creation process was a bit heavy-handed.  Users were overwhelmed with having to do too much, too soon.  So I scaled this back a bit, finding a happy medium whereby users were encouraged, but not required, to create/post a video during account creation.

            <h2>Defining a symbol for my brand</h2>
            <p>In the Branding stage I finalized the aesthetics, making key decisions to select a consistent design library for typefaces, colors, and other key visual elements.
            For my logo, I used a cross section of the earth as a callback to a “classroom educational poster” feeling.  The concentric circles also resembled radiating sound waves.

            <h2>Choosing the correct palette</h2>
            <p>Because there were many colors in the logo (and ultimately in the brand itself) I drew inspiration, among other things, from the iconic Mexico 68 olympics artwork, which seemed relevant both for it’s ability to combine many colors and also for what the olympics represents in terms of connecting cultures.

            <h2>Thinking With Type</h2>
            <p>For logo and headings I chose Work Sans as a round option with playful elements.  For example: the lowercase t has an asymmetric crossbar and an ornate and rounded terminal, the decorative apostraphe and the loop-tailed lowercase g.  These items gave a playful voice to headings in the app, bringing some fun and whimsy to the user experience. For body and buttons I chose a more straightforward Roboto for simplicity.

            After elaborate designing and test, I’m confident that this design is prepared to graduate to the Development phase.  I arrived at some key insights during the the design process of the Bróg application:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <br />
            <li>
            My initial suspicions about the necessity of this product were solidified with initial users interviews.  There were no surprises at this stage, and the results further solidified our confidence that there was a gap to be bridged in the market.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
            My first mockups used some slightly more experimental account creation flows, which included a more elaborate engagement process before even provide key user details.  After user testing I scaled this back to still provide some quick wins but err on the side of convention.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
            In an app that carves out a specific niche, it’s more important than usual to clarify multiple times the fundamental concept of the app.  In this case, it’s vital for users to realize that this is NOT an app that will generally teach you to a language a la DuoLingo or something like Rosetta Stone.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>

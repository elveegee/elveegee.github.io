          I started my career in Customer Success, starting as an IC and ultimately at the Director level.  I logged hundreds of hours in in-person user interviews with B2B customers.  As an advocate the user I collaborated closely with Product teams to ensure designs would maximize the benefit to customers and reduce churn.  I mapped customer journeys, analyzed touchpoints, obsessed over retention.

          From 2015-2018 I also started, grew and sold a small business in the event industry, renting really cool vintage and custom-made furniture for weddings and special events.  I worked hard, bootstrapped growth, and learned a ton about business strategy.  It quickly grew beyond what could be considered a “side hustle” and I’m equally proud of its success and happy to no longer be involved.

          I believe that “good UX” goes beyond common phrases like “delighting users.”  Designers are responsible for ensuring that users are getting real value from the product, with minimal friction, in a way that minimizes client attrition, and they have to do so while impacting revenue for the company, because without that, there is no experience to speak of.
